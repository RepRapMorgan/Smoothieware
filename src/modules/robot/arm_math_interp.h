   * @defgroup BilinearInterpolate Bilinear Interpolation
   *
   * Bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation applied to a two dimensional grid.
   * The underlying function <code>f(x, y)</code> is sampled on a regular grid and the interpolation process
   * determines values between the grid points.
   * Bilinear interpolation is equivalent to two step linear interpolation, first in the x-dimension and then in the y-dimension.
   * Bilinear interpolation is often used in image processing to rescale images.
   * The CMSIS DSP library provides bilinear interpolation functions for Q7, Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.
   *
   * <b>Algorithm</b>
   * \par
   * The instance structure used by the bilinear interpolation functions describes a two dimensional data table.
   * For floating-point, the instance structure is defined as:
   * <pre>
   *   typedef struct
   *   {
   *     uint16_t numRows;
   *     uint16_t numCols;
   *     float *pData;
   * } arm_bilinear_interp_instance_f32;
   * </pre>
   *
   * \par
   * where <code>numRows</code> specifies the number of rows in the table;
   * <code>numCols</code> specifies the number of columns in the table;
   * and <code>pData</code> points to an array of size <code>numRows*numCols</code> values.
   * The data table <code>pTable</code> is organized in row order and the supplied data values fall on integer indexes.
   * That is, table element (x,y) is located at <code>pTable[x + y*numCols]</code> where x and y are integers.
   *
   * \par
   * Let <code>(x, y)</code> specify the desired interpolation point.  Then define:
   * <pre>
   *     XF = floor(x)
   *     YF = floor(y)
   * </pre>
   * \par
   * The interpolated output point is computed as:
   * <pre>
   *  f(x, y) = f(XF, YF) * (1-(x-XF)) * (1-(y-YF))
   *           + f(XF+1, YF) * (x-XF)*(1-(y-YF))
   *           + f(XF, YF+1) * (1-(x-XF))*(y-YF)
   *           + f(XF+1, YF+1) * (x-XF)*(y-YF)
   * </pre>
   * Note that the coordinates (x, y) contain integer and fractional components.
   * The integer components specify which portion of the table to use while the
   * fractional components control the interpolation processor.
   *
   * \par
   * if (x,y) are outside of the table boundary, Bilinear interpolation returns zero output.
